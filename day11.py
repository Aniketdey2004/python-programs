poem="""In twilight’s gentle, glowing light,
Where day and night softly unite,
I find your eyes, like stars above,
Guiding me to endless love.

Your laughter, like a sweet refrain,
Echoes in my heart’s domain,
And in the silence, where dreams start,
I hear the whispers of your heart.

The moonlight dances on your face,
A tender touch, a warm embrace,
And in this night, so calm and true,
I lose myself in thoughts of you.

For in your arms, I’ve found my place,
A world of love, a gentle grace,
And as the stars shine from above,
I know that I am truly loved."""
